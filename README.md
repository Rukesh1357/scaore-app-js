# Cricket Score Dashboard

This project is currently a static frontend:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

It is mobile-friendly and can be hosted for free as a website.

Important first:

- You asked for free hosting with no charges for lifetime.
- No provider can guarantee "free forever" for lifetime.
- What they offer is a free tier as of today, and that can change later.
- If you want the lowest billing risk, use only a pure static hosting free tier and do not enable paid add-ons.

So the correct practical answer is:

- host the current static version on a free static host now
- if you want real shared scoring for 5 members, build a backend and deploy that as production

## Current Limitation Of This Version

This app currently stores:

- users
- admin state
- current match
- saved match resume

in browser `localStorage`.

That means:

- if 5 different people open the site on 5 different mobiles, they will not share the same live data
- each browser will keep its own local copy
- this version is fine for UI demo / testing / single-browser use
- this version is not yet a true multi-user production system

## Best Free Hosting Options For This Current Version

These are good for publishing the current frontend for mobile/browser access:

1. `Cloudflare Pages`
2. `GitHub Pages`
3. `Netlify`
4. `Vercel`

All of them support mobile browsers because they simply host your HTML/CSS/JS site publicly over HTTPS.

## Recommendation

For your current app, use:

1. `Cloudflare Pages` if you want the easiest free public hosting
2. `GitHub Pages` if your code is already on GitHub

If your priority is:

- "I do not want surprise billing"

then prefer:

1. `Cloudflare Pages`
2. `GitHub Pages`

and avoid using paid platform features, serverless functions, or add-ons.

## Safest From Billing Risk

### 1. Cloudflare Pages

Safest recommendation for this project.

Why:

- strong free tier for static sites
- good mobile delivery
- simple direct upload
- lower risk for a basic static site if you do not enable extra paid products

### 2. GitHub Pages

Also low risk if:

- your repo is public
- your site stays a normal static site

## Less Safe If You Want Zero Billing Risk

These are not "bad", but I would not put them first if your main goal is avoiding any possible charge:

1. `Netlify`
2. `Vercel`

Reason:

- they have free plans
- but they also have clearer usage-based/platform billing paths if you later enable extra features
- so for strict peace of mind, `Cloudflare Pages` or `GitHub Pages` are safer picks

## 1. Cloudflare Pages

Best simple free option for this project.

Official links:

- Cloudflare Pages overview: https://pages.cloudflare.com/
- Cloudflare Pages docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/

### Steps

1. Create a free Cloudflare account.
2. Open Cloudflare Pages.
3. Click `Create a project`.
4. Choose `Direct Upload` if you want the fastest setup.
5. Upload these files:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
6. Click deploy.
7. Cloudflare will give you a free public URL.
8. Open that URL on your mobile browser and test it.

### What happens there

- Cloudflare hosts your site on a CDN
- you get HTTPS automatically
- users can open the link on mobile or browser

### Good for

- free public hosting
- mobile access
- demo/testing
- easy deployment

### Billing note

- For a plain static site on the current free tier, you should normally not be charged.
- But Cloudflare still does not legally mean "free forever for lifetime."
- Always check the current pricing page before deploying.

### Not enough for

- shared live scoreboard between multiple users
- true admin/user control across different devices

## 2. GitHub Pages

Best if you want free hosting directly from GitHub.

Official links:

- GitHub Pages docs: https://docs.github.com/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages

### Steps

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Create a new public repository.
3. Upload:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
4. Open repository `Settings`.
5. Open `Pages`.
6. Under source, choose your main branch and root folder.
7. Save.
8. GitHub will generate a public site URL.
9. Open that URL on mobile/browser.

### What happens there

- GitHub serves your static files publicly
- your site becomes accessible from mobile browsers

### Good for

- free static hosting
- version control
- easy updates via GitHub push

### Billing note

- GitHub Pages is free for public repositories.
- But limits still apply and GitHub pricing/policies can change in the future.

## 3. Netlify

Good if you like manual drag-and-drop deploy.

Official links:

- Netlify docs: https://docs.netlify.com/

### Steps

1. Create a free Netlify account.
2. Click `Add new site`.
3. Choose manual deploy or connect GitHub.
4. Upload:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
5. Netlify gives you a public site URL.
6. Open it on mobile/browser.

## 4. Vercel

Also works well for static hosting.

Official links:

- Vercel docs: https://vercel.com/docs

### Steps

1. Create a free Vercel account.
2. Import your GitHub repo or upload the project.
3. Deploy.
4. Vercel gives you a public URL.

## Which One Should You Choose

For your case:

- easiest and safest free host now: `Cloudflare Pages`
- best if already using GitHub: `GitHub Pages`
- avoid `Netlify` and `Vercel` if your main goal is "minimum billing risk"

## Files You Need To Upload

For the current version, upload only:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

## Mobile Compatibility

Your site is already responsive enough to open on:

- Android browsers
- iPhone Safari
- desktop browsers
- tablets

So any of the above static hosts will make it accessible on mobile.

## Reality Check For 5 Members

If you host the current project on any static host:

- 5 members can open the site
- but they will not share one common live match state
- the admin changes will not sync across all devices

If you want all 5 members to operate the same scoreboard live, you need backend storage and authentication.

## Production Version

For real production, you need 3 things:

1. frontend hosting
2. login/authentication
3. shared database for match state

## Best Production Option For Small Group

For 5 members, the simplest practical production stack is:

- `Firebase Hosting`
- `Firebase Authentication`
- `Cloud Firestore`

Official links:

- Firebase Hosting quickstart: https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart
- Firebase Hosting docs: https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/
- Firebase Authentication web start: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start
- Firestore docs: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore

Why this is a good production option:

- easier than building AWS from scratch
- easier real-time sync for all members
- simple login setup
- easier mobile/browser support
- good for a small live scoring app

## Production Architecture

### Frontend

Host the website on:

- Firebase Hosting

### Auth

Use:

- Firebase Authentication

Recommended:

- email/password or admin-created users

### Shared Data

Store in:

- Cloud Firestore

Example collections:

- `users`
- `match`
- `events`
- `controller`

## Production Flow

1. Admin logs in.
2. Admin creates allowed users.
3. All users log in from their mobile/browser.
4. Current controller updates score.
5. Match state is saved in Firestore.
6. All connected users see the same live updates instantly.
7. If someone logs out and logs in again, they resume from shared backend data.

## Alternative Production Option On AWS

If you want AWS production later, use:

- `AWS Amplify Hosting`
- `Amazon Cognito`
- `DynamoDB`
- `Lambda` or `AppSync`

Official links:

- AWS Amplify getting started: https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/getting-started/
- Amplify Hosting docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/getting-started.html

This is powerful, but more setup than Firebase for a small 5-user app.

## Recommended Path For You

### If you want a public demo link today

Use:

1. `Cloudflare Pages`

### If you want real production for 5 members

Use:

1. `Firebase Hosting`
2. `Firebase Authentication`
3. `Cloud Firestore`

## Step-By-Step Plan

### Option A: Free demo hosting now

1. Create a Cloudflare account.
2. Open Pages.
3. Upload the 3 project files.
4. Deploy.
5. Share the generated link with your users.
6. Do not enable paid extras or advanced products if you want to stay on the safest free path.

### Option B: Production build

1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Enable Firebase Hosting.
3. Enable Firebase Authentication.
4. Create user login flow.
5. Create Firestore collections for users and match state.
6. Replace `localStorage` in this app with Firestore reads/writes.
7. Deploy the frontend to Firebase Hosting.
8. Test with all 5 users on mobile.

## Final Recommendation

If your goal is:

- free public hosting now
- mobile compatibility
- quick sharing by link

then use `Cloudflare Pages`.

If your goal is:

- real shared live scoring
- admin and 5 users using the same data
- resume and sync across devices

then build production with `Firebase`.

## Next Step

If you want, I can do either of these next:

1. update this project for free static hosting on `Cloudflare Pages`
2. convert this project toward real production with `Firebase Hosting + Auth + Firestore`
